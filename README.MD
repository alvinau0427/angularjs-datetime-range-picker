> Datetime Range Picker develop with AngularJS

This date range picker component creates a dropdown menu from which a user can
select a range of dates. I created it while building the UI for [Improvely](http://www.improvely.com), 
which needed a way to select date ranges for reports.

Features include limiting the selectable date range, localizable strings and date formats,
a single date picker mode, a time picker, and predefined date ranges.

## Personal Modification
- The original author do not have any clearly explain how to display the time imput, the interaction in the form of buttons, how to extract the relevant time, and how to change the picker color. Then, I inserted the personal changes for the code.
